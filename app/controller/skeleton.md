This is an example controller which controls how to add additional meta boxes
to an event description and when to update events display.
It does extend `Ai1ec_Base` class which is a part of Core and provides access
to Core class loader.
This is an internal constant defining the name of input field on event
edit page.
Checks if user has selected checkbox indicating that event is soldout.
If yes - call model to update the information.
```php
class Ai1ecsa_Skeleton_Controller extends Ai1ec_Base {const SKELETON_META_CHECKBOX = 'ai1ecsa-skeleton-soldout';public function handle_save_event( Ai1ec_Event $event ) {
```
You may prefer to use model (read more about MVC pattern
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
or [here](http://martinfowler.com/tags/model-view-controller.html)).
This model is [described in details here](../model/skeleton-soldout.md).
```php
$this->_registry->get( 'model.skeleton-soldout' )
```
Generate HTML box to be rendered on event editing page.
```php
public function post_meta_box() {
```
This is a convenient method to check if All-in-One Event Calendar
event is being edited.
```php
if ( ! $this->_registry->get( 'acl.aco' )->are_we_editing_our_post() ) {
```
Get Event by ID and check it's status using model (see above for
more details).
```php
try {
```
This means that event is not yet saved.
This is a way to use Core templating system. It provides a few features,
security being amongst them, which make it more convenient than default
WordPress one.

You are ought to place templates in one of these folders in plugin
main directory:
* `public/admin/twig/` - for templates used in admin side; you need
to set third argument to `true` in that case, in the call bellow;
* `public/themes-ai1ec/vortex/twig/` - for front-end views.

The `get_file` accepts file path starting at one of these directories.
In this case it is template `ai1ecsa-post-meta-box.twig` for admin side
view so the file will be `public/admin/twig/ai1ecsa-post-meta-box.twig`.
You may also use directories, i.e. create file
`public/admin/twig/skeleton/soldout/meta-box.twig` and then require it
by using `skeleton/soldout/meta-box.twig` value in the method bellow.

Second argument to the function `get_file` is a list of values to be
passed to template. It must be an array, where keys will become variable
names in the template. In this case `$args` contains key `title` with
value `'Event is Sold Out'` and `checked` with either `true` or `false`
as its value. In template `{{ title }}`, `{{ id }}` and `{{ checked }}`
variables will be made available.
```php
}$this->_registry->get( 'theme.loader' )->get_file(
```
